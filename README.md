# Pipe-Dreams

# Core of the game
Learning and mastering different types of movement while traveling inside a pipe and avoiding obstacles.

# Features
Different types of movement, with variations:

## Running(riding) around the pipe surface (TAP) + different jumps (SWIPE)
* Player is rotating around the center point of pipe.
* **TAP** changes rotation direction.
* **Holding TAP** slows rotation down to 0.
* **SWIPE** activates **JUMP** mechanic:
1. **Mini jump**: 
Player jumps to the center point of pipe and falls down, back to the position he jumped from.
There is no rotation during this jump.
2. **Big jump**:
Player jumps to the opposite side of the pipe
3. **Side jump**
Player jumps to the center and back, but the rotation is included, so he doesn't land on the position he jumped from.

## Flying through pipe
* **SWIPE** moves the player through the air in the direction of the swipe. Movement is limited so player can't hit the surface of the pipe.
* **TAP** (PUT IDEA HERE)

## Flappy mode
* **TAP** Player moves in one *line*. He is pulled by "gravity" to one end of the line, and by **TAP**ing he pushes back
in the opposite direction. This *line* of movement can be vertical or rotated around the center of pipe.
